## Concept

Data present in MDX/MD files is harnessed for Static Site Generation (SSG) with NextJS, enabling the static population of pages during the build phase. This approach significantly enhances page performance for static websites. SSG optimizes loading times and streamlines updates to the website's data, ensuring ease of maintenance and facilitating efficient content modifications.
